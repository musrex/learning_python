I'm gonna marry Cordelia!

Dear Cordelia,
I think you're pretty cute. I love the way you laugh and ask questions.
My favorite color is the color of your eyes. I love the way your hair
brushes against your face. I can't wait to marry you. Lets just elope.
No, at this point everyone would be upset. We should defintely have a
big wedding. Maybe at the MET. Yeah, lets do that. I think your dad 
might be able to afford it. Just kidding lets just do the closest state
park. That would be really cute. 

With Love,
Leandro
